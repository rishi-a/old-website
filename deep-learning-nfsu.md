## **Deep Learning Lab(Spring 2023)**

I'm co-teaching Deep Learning for Cybersecurity with [Dr. Ahlad Kumar](https://nfsu.ac.in/Faculty/profile?userid=163) at National Forensic Sciences University [(NFSU)](https://www.nfsu.ac.in/), as a part of my Prime Ministers' Research Fellowship ([PMRF](https://www.pmrf.in/)) Teaching Assistance (TA) work. My responsibilites include conducting lab sessions, designing lab assignments and curating theoretical quiz materials.
