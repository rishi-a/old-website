##### **About Me**

<img class="pad-2" align="right" width="110" height="110" src="/images/RISHIRAJ.jpg">
<!--<img class="pad-1" align="right" width="200" height="170" src="/images/IMG-20190202-WA0001.jpg">
-->Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student and a Prime Minister's Research Fellow (PMRF) at the Computer Science Engineering discipline of [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/). [Prof. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/) supervises me.  My research interest is in Ubiquitous Computing. My current focus is designing wearables that measure health parameters and exposure to air pollutions. I did my schooling in Shillong, India and grew up there, although I was born in the Indian state of Assam.
