My work will focus on Computational Sustainability and Sensor networks. The image on the left was taken on the way to Shillong Peak in Meghalaya. I did my schooling from Shillong and grew up there although I was born in Assam. [*Why am I doing a PhD?*](https://rishi-a.github.io/2019/05/23/why-phd-and-not-a-job.html)
