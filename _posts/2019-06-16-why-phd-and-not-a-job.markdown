1. You never retire in the job you do after doing a Ph.D. See Point 2

2. You did a Ph.D. to specialize in a domain where work is fun, and that is what you aspire to do in your entire life. 

3. Have you seen people like Prof. Gilbert Strang and Prof. Lewin? Did they ever retire? Do they feel bored with what they do?  Post Ph.D. life is like those of these people if not identical â€” calm, composed, and busy in cerebral activity.

4. In India, Ph.D. degree comes in various ways. Money is one of them! Do yourself a favor, if you are aspiring to do Ph.D. from India, do it from a premier institution.
