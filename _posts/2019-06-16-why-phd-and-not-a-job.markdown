I was recently shortlisted for Ph.D. admission at IIT Gandhinagar after clearing the written test and interview. Before this, I was working as a JRF in the same institute under <a href="https://nipunbatra.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Nipun Batra</a> since March 2019. From August 2018 to January 2019, I was doing MS (By Research) and Teaching Assistantship at IIIT Sricity. For some reasons, I decided to leave the MS program at Sricity. Meeting and working under <a href="http://vvtesh.co.in" target="_blank">Prof. Venkatesh Vinayakarao</a> was the most fabulous thing that happened there. 

After my BTech in ECE at Gauhati University, I primarily worked for about 3.5 years in multiple organizations in the Web Design and Development domain. I was even into freelancing. 3.5 years and I was done with those Jobs. I loved the 9-5 (or 9 to 6.30) culture but eventually thought that I did not want to continue that way. 

Government job was an excellent option to try. But the State Govt. is something I feel fishy about and the Central Government seems too good for a person like me. ;) 

So, Ph.D. seems to be what I wanted to do. I enjoy the essence of understanding complicated looking concepts. That mindful satisfaction is hard to explain. I think the following are useful points in favor of doing a Ph.D.

1. You never retire in the job you do after doing a Ph.D. Why?  See Point 2

2. You do a Ph.D. to specialize in a domain where work is fun, and that is what you aspire to do in your entire life. 

3. Have you seen people like Prof. Gilbert Strang and Prof. Lewin? Did they ever retire? Do they feel bored with what they do?  Post Ph.D. life is like those of these people if not identical â€” calm, composed, and busy in cerebral activity.

4. In India, Ph.D. degree comes in various ways. Money is one of them! Do yourself a favor, if you are aspiring to do Ph.D. from India, do it from a premier institution (IISc, IITs maybe). 

5. Ph.D. stipend may not be very attractive to some. But saving at least 15k+ and life in a vibrant campus of IIT is actually awesome. (Awesome for a middle class like me)


So, that is it. I hope my journey will be fulfilling. I know it will be full of challenges and pressure, but anything worth having is difficult to have, and it is climbing that mountain that is important.
